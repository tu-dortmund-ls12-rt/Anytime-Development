# Artifact Evaluation Guide

**Paper:** Anytime ROS 2: Timely Task Completion in Non-Preemptive Robotic Systems
**Authors:** Harun Teper, TU Dortmund University
**Venue:** RTAS 2026
**Paper PDF:** [`main.pdf`](main.pdf) (included in repository root)

## Overview

This artifact can be evaluated through three paths depending on available hardware. **Path A (Jetson via SSH) is recommended** — the board is pre-configured and ready to use.

| Path | Hardware | Figures Covered | Setup Time |
| ---- | -------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| **A: Jetson via SSH (Recommended)** | Provided by authors | All (5a, 5b, 6, 7a, 7b, Table I) | ~5 min |
| **B: Local with NVIDIA GPU** | NVIDIA desktop GPU + Docker | All (5a, 5b, 6, 7a, 7b, Table I) | ~30–60 min (build) |
| **C: Local CPU only** | Any x86_64 Linux + Docker | CPU only (5a, 5b, 6, Table I) | ~20–40 min (build) |

---

## Path A: NVIDIA Jetson Board via SSH (Recommended)

An NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX board is provided at TU Dortmund University with everything pre-configured: Docker image built, workspace compiled, YOLO weights and test images downloaded.

> **Credentials:** SSH credentials are provided in a **separate confidential document** submitted alongside this artifact. They are intentionally not included in this repository. If you did not receive credentials, please contact the authors.

> **Shared access:** Only one Jetson board is available. If multiple reviewers are evaluating concurrently, please coordinate to avoid running experiments simultaneously on the same board, as this would affect timing results.

### Connect to the Jetson board

```bash
ssh -p <JETSON_PORT> <JETSON_USERNAME>@<JETSON_IP>
# Password: <JETSON_PASSWORD>
```

Replace the `<...>` placeholders with the values from the confidential credentials document.

### Enter the Docker container

```bash
cd ~/Anytime-Development
docker compose run --rm anytime-jetson bash
```

### Build the workspace and run experiments

Inside the container:

```bash
cd packages && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
cd ..

# Run smoke test (< 2 minutes)
./scripts/smoke_test.sh

# Quick CPU experiments (~10 minutes)
./scripts/run_all.sh --quick --cpu-only

# Full reproduction including YOLO (~5+ hours)
./scripts/run_all.sh --full

# Run only GPU experiments (~3 hours)
./scripts/run_all.sh --full --gpu-only

# Run specific experiment groups
./scripts/run_all.sh --full --monte-carlo
./scripts/run_all.sh --full --interference
./scripts/run_all.sh --full --yolo

# Or reproduce individual figures (see table below)
./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 5a --quick
```

YOLO weights and test images are **pre-downloaded** on the board. No additional setup is needed for GPU experiments.

If you wish to re-download them (e.g., to verify integrity), see [YOLO Prerequisites](#yolo-prerequisites-gpu-only--paths-a--b) below.

### Copy results to your local machine

Copy just the paper figures (recommended):

```bash
scp -P <JETSON_PORT> -r <JETSON_USERNAME>@<JETSON_IP>:~/Anytime-Development/paper_figures/ ./paper_figures/
```

Or copy all experiment results (includes additional diagnostic plots and raw data):

```bash
scp -P <JETSON_PORT> -r <JETSON_USERNAME>@<JETSON_IP>:~/Anytime-Development/experiments/*/results/ ./results/
```

docker compose run --rm anytime-cpu bash
```

### Build the workspace and run experiments

Inside the container:

```bash
cd packages && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
cd ..

# Run smoke test (< 2 minutes)
./scripts/smoke_test.sh

# Quick CPU experiments (~10 minutes)
./scripts/run_all.sh --quick --cpu-only

# Full CPU experiments (~1.5 hours)
./scripts/run_all.sh --full --cpu-only

# Or reproduce individual figures (see table below)
./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 5a --quick
```

## Reproducing Paper Figures

Each figure can be reproduced with a single command. The `--quick` flag uses fewer batch sizes and shorter runs to demonstrate the same trends faster.

| Paper Element | Command | Full Duration | Quick Mode | Platforms |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Figure 5a (segment count vs batch size) | `./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 5a` | ~40 min | `--quick` ~5 min | A, B, C |
| Figure 5b (cancellation delay) | `./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 5b` | ~40 min | `--quick` ~5 min | A, B, C |
| Figures 5a + 5b (both) | `./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 5` | ~40 min | `--quick` ~5 min | A, B, C |
| Figures 6a + 6b + Table I (interference) | `./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 6` | ~40 min | `--quick` ~3 min | A, B, C |
| Figure 7a (YOLO quality progression) | `./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 7a` | ~30 min | N/A | A, B |
| Figure 7b (YOLO runtime comparison) | `./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 7b` | ~1 hr | N/A | A, B |
| Figures 7a + 7b (both) | `./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 7` | ~1.5 hrs | N/A | A, B |

## Output Locations

After experiments complete, all paper figures and Table I are automatically collected into a single directory for easy access:

```
paper_figures/
├── figure_5a_batch_size_vs_iterations.pdf
├── figure_5b_cancellation_delay.pdf
├── figure_6a_jitter_vs_batch_size.pdf
├── figure_6b_compute_time_vs_batch_size.pdf
├── figure_7a_quality_ratio_progression.pdf
├── figure_7b_throughput_comparison.png
└── table_1_interference_metrics.csv
```

You can also re-collect figures at any time by running:

```bash
./scripts/collect_figures.sh
```

### Detailed output locations

The full experiment results (including additional diagnostic plots and raw data) remain in their respective experiment directories:

| Figure / Data | Output File |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Figure 5a | `experiments/monte_carlo/results/plots/batch_size_vs_iterations.pdf` |
| Figure 5b | `experiments/monte_carlo/results/plots/cancellation_delay.pdf` |
| Figure 6a | `experiments/interference/results/plots/jitter_vs_batch_size.pdf` |
| Figure 6b | `experiments/interference/results/plots/compute_time_vs_batch_size.pdf` |
| Figure 7a | `experiments/yolo/results/quality_analysis/quality_ratio_progression.pdf` |
| Figure 7b | `experiments/yolo/results/runtime_analysis/throughput_comparison.png` |
| Table I (CSV) | `experiments/interference/results/aggregated_results.csv` |

### Additional diagnostic plots

Each experiment generates additional plots beyond the paper figures:

- **Monte Carlo:** `experiments/monte_carlo/results/plots/` — throughput, latency breakdowns, timing distributions
- **Interference:** `experiments/interference/results/plots/` — timer period distributions, missed period rates
- **YOLO quality:** `experiments/yolo/results/quality_analysis/` — detection progression, layer timing, cancellation histograms
- **YOLO throughput:** `experiments/yolo/results/runtime_analysis/` — per-config stacked timing, cumulative runtime
- **YOLO cancellation:** `experiments/yolo/results/phase4_analysis/` — cancellation delay, layers processed, block size metrics

## YOLO Prerequisites (GPU only — Paths A & B)

> **Path A note:** The Jetson board has weights and images **pre-downloaded**. You can skip this section unless you want to re-download them.

Before running YOLO experiments on Path B (or to re-download on Path A), download the model weights and test images:

```bash
# Download YOLO weights
cd packages/src/anytime_yolo
wget https://tu-dortmund.sciebo.de/s/W86QE9hUscsUPeM/download -O weights.zip
unzip -o weights.zip -d .
rm weights.zip
cd ../../..

# Download test images
mkdir -p packages/src/video_publisher/images
cd packages/src/video_publisher/images
wget https://tu-dortmund.sciebo.de/s/aA9MDhgN2lBmeZk/download -O images.zip
unzip -o images.zip -d .
rm images.zip
cd ../../../..
```

## Environment Details

The Docker images provide a complete, self-contained environment:

- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy)
- **ROS 2:** Humble Hawksbill (built from source)
- **DDS:** CycloneDDS (`RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`)
- **Build system:** colcon
- **Tracing:** LTTng (lttng-tools, liblttng-ust-dev, python3-babeltrace)
- **GPU image (Path B):** CUDA 12.5, TensorRT 10.3.0
- **Jetson image (Path A):** NVIDIA JetPack 6 (L4T r36.4.0), CUDA 12.6, TensorRT 10.3.0
- **Python:** pandas, numpy (< 2.0), matplotlib

All tracing uses LTTng userspace tracepoints defined in `packages/src/anytime_tracing/`. Traces are collected automatically by the experiment scripts and parsed by the evaluation scripts using `babeltrace`.

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails with missing dependencies:**

```bash
cd packages
rm -rf build/ install/ log/
colcon build --symlink-install
```

**LTTng session already exists:**

```bash
lttng destroy
# Then re-run the experiment
```

**No GPU available but want to run CPU experiments:**

```bash
./scripts/run_all.sh --quick --cpu-only
# OR
./scripts/reproduce_figure.sh 5a --quick
```

**Permission denied on scripts:**

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh experiments/monte_carlo/*.sh experiments/interference/*.sh experiments/yolo/*.sh
```

**Docker compose not found:**

Ensure Docker Compose V2 is installed. With modern Docker Engine, `docker compose` (without hyphen) should work. If using older Docker, install `docker-compose` separately.

**Traces directory not writable:**

LTTng requires the `tracing` group. Inside the container, the `vscode` user should already be a member. If not:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG tracing vscode
```

**SSH connection refused or timed out (Path A):**

Verify you are using the correct IP, port, username, and password from the confidential credentials document. Ensure you are connected to a network that allows outbound SSH on the specified port. If the connection still fails, contact the authors.

**Docker container already running on the Jetson (Path A):**

If another reviewer's container is still running, you may see a port conflict or resource contention. Check with:

```bash
docker ps
```

If a container is running, wait for the other reviewer to finish, or coordinate access. Do not run experiments concurrently, as this affects timing results.
